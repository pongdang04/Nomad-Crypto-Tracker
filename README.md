# Project Features

This project fetches cryptocurrency data from an API(paprika coins api) and displays it on a landing page. 
Each name of the coin is listed, and when you click on a specific coin, you will be directed to a detailed page where more information about the coin is shown. 
That detailed page includes a price chart which visualizes the price data for the selected coin.

(Currently, the API has become a paid service, and the page is unable to load further due to this restriction.)
